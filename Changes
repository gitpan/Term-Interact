0.41 Tue Jun 19 2002
        - upgraded documentation.
        - major simplification of the API.  Sorry, no backward
          compatability, but the new API rocks. 
        - added translate method.
        - added filetest check.
        - added various formatting parms for greater "look
          and feel" control.
        - *all* output to FH_OUT now uses format() from 
          Text::Autoformat for consistency.
        - added AUTOLOADING of get/set methods for modifying
          parameters stored in Term::Interact objects.
        - added new_check method to offload processing of
          check parms from the individual check subs.  Now
          all the check subs expect check objects, which 
          are constructed by new_check.
